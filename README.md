# Abstract:
This project is way to study the connectivity of Connecticut Streams. We use a collection of images that were taken by cameras across Connecticut. Water connectivity is important for many reasons. One reason is because it allows species to cross over to different habitats and allows sediments and nutrients to move across the water ecosystem. The data allows us to see the changes of the water connectivity overtime and it shows us if there are decreases or the increases in water in the streams. It allows us to see when the changes happen and allows us to see if seasons have to do with change in water connectivity or if it is another reason.

# My Project:
My project allows users to see the dates the photographs of the streams were taken and where their location is in Connecticut. It also shows how dry or flooded the stream is. The map shows the different locations by having dots on where the site is. The slider allows the user to pick a date they specifically want to see and it displays all the photographs of that exact date. It does not include dates that do not have data, so it allows you to always see data. The colors indicate how much water is in the stream (whether it is flooded, dry or in between).

# Instructions on How to Use:
1. Use the blue slider to find the date that you are looking for

2. After the pictures appear, scroll down to find the pictures you want to view (the date is written as follows: year/month/day)
3. Then look at the legend for the colors to determine how much water does the stream in the photograph has (the legend is on top of the slider)

In the Screenshot above, you can see that the first photograph in the first row is closer to flooded water conditions. With these three steps, you can figure out how the water conditions are and how to find photographs of data.
